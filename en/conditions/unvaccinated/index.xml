      <description>The study compares vaccinated and undervaccinated children in the USA. Undervaccinated are the children who have not received at least one vaccine, or received at least one vaccine even one day later than the prescribed time limit.
Those who were undervaccinated by their parents’ choice used emergency care 9% less often, visited doctors 5% less often, and also had pharyngitis and URTI 11% less often.
The number of undervaccinated children is steadily increasing (from 42% in 2004 to 54% in 2008).</description>

      <description>Macaques were given childhood vaccines according to the vaccination schedule in USA in 1999 and were compared with the unvaccinated macaques.
The vaccinated macaques had a much larger brain volume (this is observed in autistic children).
The amygdala (brain region responsible for emotions) was much larger in the vaccinated macaques, than the unvaccinated ones. (This also is observed in autistic children).</description>

      <description>New Zealand, 23 unvaccinated (against DTP and Polio) out of 1,256 10-year old children. Out of the vaccinated children 23% had asthma, 22% got consults on asthma, and 30% had allergies.
There wasn’t a single case of asthma, or consults on asthma, or allergies among the unvaccinated children.</description>

      <description>The study compares homeschooled children in four states of the USA. 405 vaccinated and 261 unvaccinated children.
Acute diseases:
Vaccinated children had chicken pox 4 times less often, whopping cough – 3 times less often and rubella – 10 times less often.
Vaccinated children had otitis media 4 times more often and pneumonia – 6 times more often.
Chronic diseases:
Those vaccinated had allergic rhinitis 30 times more often. They had allergies 4 times more often, ASD – 4 more often, ADHD – 4 times more often, eczema – 3 times more often, learning disabilities – 5 times more often, neurological disorders – 4 times more often.</description>

      <description>Due to the fact that in Guinea-Bissau children were vaccinated once in three months, it turned out to be a natural experiment. Some children have already been vaccinated by the age of 3-5 months, and some haven’t.
The risk of death in children vaccinated against diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis (DTP) was 10 times higher than that of the unvaccinated children. Children who were also vaccinated against poliomyelitis (OPV) died only 5 times more often that the unvaccinated children.</description>

      <description>A poll in New Zealand. 226 vaccinated and 269 unvaccinated children.
The vaccinated children had asthma 5 times more often, tonsillitis– 10 times more often, dermatitis – 2 times more often, apnea – 4 times more often, hyperactivity – 4 times more often, otitis media – 4 times more often, and they had ear drainage tube inserted 8 times more often.
5% of the vaccinated children had tonsils removed. There were no tonsils removals among unvaccinated children.</description>

      <description>A study of 30 thousand children from the UK.
Children vaccinated against diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis/polio had asthma 14 times more often and eczema – 9 times more often than unvaccinated children.
Children vaccinated against measles/mumps/rubella had asthma 3.5 times more often and eczema – 4.5 times more often.
The numbers seem to speak for themselves, right? But these figures do not suit the authors, as they want to justify vaccinations. So they do two sleights of hand.</description>
