  <span class="font-italic">2017,  JTS</span>
</h6>

<p>The study compares homeschooled children in four states of the USA. 405 vaccinated and 261 unvaccinated children.<br />
<em>Acute diseases:</em><br />
Vaccinated children had chicken pox 4 times less often, whopping cough – 3 times less often and rubella – 10 times less often.<br />
Vaccinated children had otitis media 4 times more often and pneumonia – 6 times more often.<br />
<em>Chronic diseases:</em><br />
Those vaccinated had allergic rhinitis 30 times more often. They had allergies 4 times more often, ASD – 4 more often, ADHD – 4 times more often, eczema – 3 times more often, learning disabilities – 5 times more often, neurological disorders – 4 times more often. Vaccinated children had any type of chronic illness 2.5 times more often.<br />
Vaccinated children used allergy medicines 21 times more often, antipyretics – 4.5 times more often, ear-drainage tubes – 8 times more often. They went to see a doctor, due to illness, 3 times more often and were hospitalized 1.8 times more often.<br />
Some more interesting results from this study: risk of neurological disorders associated with the use of antibiotics during pregnancy (2.3 times), use of medicine during pregnancy (2.5 times), prematurity (5 times), ultrasound (1.7 times), and ultrasound done more than 3 times during pregnancy – 3.2 times.<br />
The number of neurological disorders in vaccinated children (14.4%) coincides with the CDC studies (15%). The number of learning disabilities also coincides (5.6% of the vaccinated children in this study, and 5% according to available statistics).<br />
However, judging by this study, there is already 3.3% of autistic children among vaccinated, i.e. 1 in 30 children. But, perhaps, it is an overestimation, as it is likely that children with ASD are homeschooled more often. (According to the CDC 2.24% of children are with ASD, i.e. 1 in 45 in 2015 and 1 in 36 in 2017).<br />

  <span class="font-italic">2017,  EBioMedicine</span>
</h6>

<p>Due to the fact that in Guinea-Bissau children were vaccinated once in three months, it turned out to be a natural experiment. Some children have already been vaccinated by the age of 3-5 months, and some haven’t.<br />
The risk of death in children vaccinated against diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis (DTP) was 10 times higher than that of the unvaccinated children. Children who were also vaccinated against poliomyelitis (OPV) died only 5 times more often that the unvaccinated children.<br />
After vaccination started, infant mortality at the age over 3 months increased by 2 times.<br />
The author of the study concludes that the vaccine against diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis kills more children than it saves.<br />
The authors can hardly be accused of being anti-vaccination. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Aaby" target="_blank">Peter Aaby</a>, one of the authors of the study, created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandim_Health_Project" target="_blank">Bandim Health Project</a> in Guinea-Bissau, one of the main goals of which is to vaccinate children.</p>

<p>New Zealand, 23 unvaccinated (against DTP and Polio) out of 1,256 10-year old children. Out of the vaccinated children 23% had asthma, 22% got consults on asthma, and 30% had allergies.<br />
There wasn’t a single case of asthma, or consults on asthma, or allergies among the unvaccinated children.</p>

  <span class="font-italic">2013,  JAMA Pediatr</span>
</h6>

<p>The study compares vaccinated and undervaccinated children in the USA. Undervaccinated are the children who have not received at least one vaccine, or received at least one vaccine even one day later than the prescribed time limit.<br />
Those who were undervaccinated by their parents’ choice used emergency care 9% less often, visited doctors 5% less often, and also had pharyngitis and URTI 11% less often.<br />
The number of undervaccinated children is steadily increasing (from 42% in 2004 to 54% in 2008).</p>

<p>Macaques were given childhood vaccines according to the vaccination schedule in USA in 1999 and were compared with the unvaccinated macaques.<br />
The vaccinated macaques had a much larger brain volume (this <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7641/full/nature21369.html" target="_blank">is observed</a> in autistic children).<br />
The amygdala (brain region responsible for emotions) was much larger in the vaccinated macaques, than the unvaccinated ones. (This also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15254095" target="_blank">is observed</a> in autistic children).</p>

<p>A poll in New Zealand. 226 vaccinated and 269 unvaccinated children.<br />
The vaccinated children had asthma 5 times more often, tonsillitis– 10 times more often, dermatitis – 2 times more often, apnea – 4 times more often, hyperactivity – 4 times more often, otitis media – 4 times more often, and they had ear drainage tube inserted 8 times more often.<br />
5% of the vaccinated children had tonsils removed. There were no tonsils removals among unvaccinated children.<br />
1.7% of the vaccinated children had epilepsy. There were no cases of epilepsy among the unvaccinated children.</p>

  <span class="font-italic">2004,  Am J Public Health</span>
</h6>

<p>A study of 30 thousand children from the UK.<br />
Children vaccinated against diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis/polio had asthma 14 times more often and eczema – 9 times more often than unvaccinated children.<br />
Children vaccinated against measles/mumps/rubella had asthma 3.5 times more often and eczema – 4.5 times more often.<br />
The numbers seem to speak for themselves, right? But these figures do not suit the authors, as they want to justify vaccinations. So they do two sleights of hand.<br />
First, they determined that unvaccinated children visit doctors less. In their opinion, this does not mean that unvaccinated children get sick less often, but rather that their chance of being diagnosed is lower than of those vaccinated! Therefore, they make a correction. It turns out not to be enough, however.<br />
They go further and divide all children into 4 groups by the number of visits to the family doctor, and then analyze each group separately. And, oh miracle, statistical significance among those who go to the doctors often disappears! But among those who went to see doctors less then 3-6 times, the vaccinated children had asthma and eczema 10-15 times more often than the unvaccinated ones anyway.<br />
Authors, with a clear consciousness, conclude that vaccinations do not increase the risk of asthma or eczema.<br />
Doctors, who only read the abstract (meaning almost everyone, since only few people read these articles in full), only learn of the conclusion and, with a calm heart, go on and continue to vaccinate children.<br />
Such sleights of hand are often found in the studies that allegedly prove the safety of vaccinations.</p>
