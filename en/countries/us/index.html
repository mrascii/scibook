<ul>
<li>Diphtheria was always considered a childhood disease, but in mid 20th century adults also began to get sick with it. In 1960, 21% of the disease cases were in adults (over 15 years of age). In 1964, there were already 36% of adults, and it 1970s – 48%. The mortality ratio has also changed. In the 1960s, 70% of those who died of diphtheria in Canada were children, in in the 1970s, 73% of those who died were adults.<br /></li>
<li>In the 1960s, the Indians suffered from diphtheria 20 times more often than white people, and 3 times more often black people. The reason is considered to be in the lack of proper hygiene due to the Indians’ poverty.<br /></li>
<li>In the late 1960s, there were diphtheria outbreaks in Austin (88 cases) and San Antonio (196 cases). Diphtheria was mainly observed in the city districts with a low socioeconomic status.<br /></li>
<li>One of the forms of diphtheria is cutaneous (skin) diphtheria. It is commonly found in homeless people, and is much less dangerous.<br />
Cutaneous diphtheria is associated mostly with the poorer population, living in crowded conditions with low hygienic standards. By 1975, 67% of diphtheria cases were of the cutaneous type, and it was mostly Indians who got sick.<br />
In an overwhelming majority of cases the cutaneous diphtheria infection is also accompanied by staphylococcus and streptococcus. It seems that a skin infection of streptococcus and staphylococcus predisposes to secondary infection with diphtheria, and the low level of hygiene is a main contributing factor.<br /></li>
<li>In the 1970s, there was a diphtheria outbreak in Seattle. Of the 558 cases, 334 were from Skid Road (i.e. homeless). 3 people died. 74% suffered from cutaneous diphtheria. 70% were heavy alcoholics.<br /></li>
<li>In 1971, there was a diphtheria outbreak in Vancouver (44 cases). Most of the cases were poor alcoholics.<br /></li>
<li>In 1973, there was an outbreak among the Indian children. 4 children with cutaneous diphtheria were the source.<br /></li>
<li>Cutaneous diphtheria was recognized as an infection reservoir in 1969 in Louisiana and Alabama. The bacterium was isolated in 30% of healthy people. Vaccinated and unvaccinated people were equally infected.<br /></li>
<li>Since the 1980s, diphtheria is almost never found in North America.<br />

Consequently, they started to vaccinate more in Baltimore. In the first half of 1944, 142 cases were already recorded. 63% of them have been vaccinated.</p>

<p>Here is the report of 119 cases of meningoencephalitis caused by mumps in San Francisco in 12 years (1943-1955). Most cases are mild, with no complications, no neurological consequences, last less than 5 days, and rarely require hospitalization. Death due to mumps meningoencephalitis is a very rare phenomenon, and in the entire medical literature only 3 such cases have been described (including one out of these 119).</p>

  <span class="font-italic">1988, Kaplan, JAMA</span>
</h6>

<p>20 years after the invention of the vaccine and 10 years after it became widely used, the first mumps outbreak (118 cases) occurred in the workplace (Chicago Futures Exchange). Total costs associated with the outbreak amounted to $120,738, whereas the vaccine costs only $4.47.<br />
The authors report that historically, vaccine prevention of mumps did not get as much attention as the other diseases, because it is a mild one. However, $1,500 per case of mumps is too expensive, when the vaccine only costs $4.47 in public and $8.80 in private sectors. Research shows that every dollar invested in the mumps vaccine, saves $7-$14.<br />
In addition, mumps in adults often leads to complications. 10-38% of post-pubertal men get orchitis. Also, mumps patients often develop meningitis (0.6% of cases among those aged 20 years or more). Getting mumps during the first trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage.<br />
In pre-vaccination times, mumps outbreaks were observed mainly in prisons, orphanages and army barracks.</p>

  <span class="font-italic">1926, Coleman, J Infect Dis</span>
</h6>

<p>The researchers ran blood tests of 104 California residents. Agglutinins to several strains of tetanus bacteria were found in the blood of 80% of them, but they did not have antibodies. The authors believe that tetanus bacteria were in the intestines of these people in the past, but did not survive there and thus they do not have the antitoxin.<br />
Tetanus agglutinins have not been researched since then.</p>

  <span class="font-italic">1926, Bauer, JSTOR</span>
</h6>

<p>In four years from 1922 to 1925 in California, 245 cases of tetanus have been recorded. Mortality rate was 67%.<br />
Among the 530 people in the study, the authors found bacteria in the intestines of 24%. They believe that the presence of tetanus bacteria in the intestines depends on the microflora, since they have always seen other types of bacteria along with tetanus bacteria, and did not see other bacteria, when the tetanus bacteria were absent.</p>

  <span class="font-italic">1995, Gergen, N Engl J Med</span>
</h6>

<p>70% of Americans had protective levels of tetanus antibodies (0.15 IU/ml). The children had protective levels higher than 80%, but much lower than the vaccination coverage (96%). Less than 5% of parents refused vaccination, meaning that refusing vaccination is not a significant factor for the absence of antibodies in the USA.<br />
It is reported <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16557581" target="_blank">here</a> that in tetanus vaccinated animals, TTC (non-toxic fragment of tetanus toxin) reached the brain in the same amount as in the unvaccinated animals.</p>

</h6>

<p>As in the case with whooping cough, it is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18000199" target="_blank">argued</a> that the vaccine is responsible for reducing the incidence of tetanus by 92%, and the mortality rate by 99%.<br />
This article analyzes cases of tetanus in USA since 1900 and shows a graph, according to which, the mortality rate decreased by more than 95% even before the vaccination began in the late 40s.</p>
