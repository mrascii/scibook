      <description>The authors performed a genetic analysis of pertussis bacterial strains in the Netherlands and concluded that the bacterium had mutated and adapted according to the vaccine. The predominate strains became those with different, mutated forms of pertactin and pertussis toxin. These strains did not exist before vaccination against pertussis began. The same trend was also observed in Finland, the USA and Italy.</description>

      <description>While the number of cases of whooping cough among unvaccinated individuals has increased, the number of cases among vaccinated individuals has increased even more. Most cases of whooping cough happen among vaccinated.
Also, according to data from the CDC, most patients with pertussis-induced whooping cough have been vaccinated.</description>
