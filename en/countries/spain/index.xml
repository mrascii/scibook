      <description>Death from diphtheria in developed countries is so rare that every such case is widely reported in the media. In 2015, a boy died of diphtheria in Spain, and in 2008, a girl died in England. These seem to be the only deaths of children from diphtheria in developed countries in the last 30 years.</description>

      <description>Among the unvaccinated women with CIN 2-3 only 28% were infected with the HPV 16 and 18 strains.
9% of the women with CIN 2-3 did not have HPV at all (Barcelona).
In another study, HPV was only found in 60% of the cases of invasive cervical cancer.</description>

      <title>Pertussis epidemic despite high levels of vaccination coverage with acellular pertussis vaccine</title>

      <description>This is an epidemiological study in Spain analysing 421 cases of Pertussis, mostly in children under the age of one year. The vast majority of infected individuals (90%) had actually been fully vaccinated. The carriers were mostly fully vaccinated children aged 5-9 years. Only 8% of the 421 cases were hospitalized, and not one died. The authors conclude that despite a high level of vaccination in Spain, whooping cough is totally uncontrollable.</description>

      <description>More than half of health workers refused to be vaccinated against influenza, and only 16.5% were vaccinated against swine flu during the 2009 pandemic. They doubted the effectiveness of the vaccination and were afraid of side effects. (Madrid, Spain)</description>
