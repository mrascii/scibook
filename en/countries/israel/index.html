<p>Mothers with an academic education are twice as likely to refuse vaccinations.<br>
Jews are 4 times more likely to refuse vaccinations than Muslims.<br>
The older the mothers, the more often they refuse vaccinations. (Israel)</p>

<p>Death from diphtheria in developed countries is so rare that every such case is widely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria#History">reported</a> in the media. In 2015, a boy died of diphtheria in Spain, and in 2008, a girl died in England. These seem to be the only deaths of children from diphtheria in developed countries in the last 30 years.</p>

<p>In Israel, since 2005 the Israeli vaccine Sci-B-Vac has been <a href="https://www.israel21c.org/hepatitis-b-no-match-for-scigens-new-vaccine">used</a>. only in the center of Israel and in the south (because the entire market can not be given to one producer).In July 2015, this vaccine was <a href="https://www.health.gov.il/NewsAndEvents/SpokemanMesseges/Pages/29072015_3.aspx">withdrawn</a>. According to a statement by the Ministry of Health, it was recalled because the ampoules arrived on the machine that glued the labels too quickly, which could theoretically result in micro-cracks and bacterial contamination. the population was asked not to worry, but the vaccine was withdrawn.Two years have passed since then, but the vaccine did not return to the market, and probably could not solve the problem of sticking labels.</p>

<p>Sci-B-Vac is a third-generation vaccine, the first generation was a live vaccine, the second generation is a recombinant (genetically modified) vaccine containing virus-like particles. The third generation vaccine contains two more antigens, and therefore gives more <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8779530">strong</a> immune response.<br>
The only published clinical trial of the vaccine <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9194109">included</a> 150 children. The vaccine <a href="http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000865960">did not receive</a> a permission from the FDA. The Ministries of Health Committee report which allowed the vaccination in Israel, somewhere <a href="http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4690411,00.html">disappeared</a>.<br>
Many parents argue that the children because of this vaccination had strong side effects, developmental delays, etc. What is not very surprising, since it contained twice as much aluminum, in addition, it has three antigens instead of one, which further increases the risk of autoimmune reaction. Why this will be dismantled in another part.</p>

  <span class="font-italic">2012, Anis, Epidemiol Infect</span>
</h6>

<p>A mumps outbreak in Israel (over 5,000 cases). 78% had been fully vaccinated. Mostly teenagers and adults got sick. In other countries (Austria, USA, Netherlands, Great Britain) mumps outbreaks were also observed among teenagers and college students, whereas in countries where there is no vaccination against mumps, children aged 5-9 years got sick.<br>
Despite the high vaccination coverage (90-97%), mumps antibodies were found in only 68% of the population.<br>
The authors report that the recent mumps outbreaks have been caused by the genotype G virus, whereas the vaccine contains genotype A. However, they do not believe that it is related to the outbreaks and suggest introducing a third dose of the vaccine.</p>

  <span class="font-italic">2000, Srugo, Emerg Infect Dis</span>
</h6>

<p>While there are hundreds of case reports for different vaccines, we have not yet cited any until now. This case occurred in the year 2000, when a whole-cell (i.e., more effective) vaccine was administered to a 2-month-old child in Israel. Despite the entire family (mother, aunt and three brothers - 2, 5 and 11 years old) being fully vaccinated, the child died of whooping cough at an age of 4 months. Moreover, both younger brothers who were at kindergarten had also been fully vaccinated with four doses. The mother of the child developed a cough that lasted for three consecutive months. The two other brothers also coughed heavily, and although the 18-year-old aunt who lived with them did not cough, she was also ill. In the end, it turned out that the whole family – five people - was infected with pertussis. In addition, five children from both kindergartens (11%) were also infected, although only two of them fell under the new definition of whooping cough as stated by the WHO. The authors of this study concluded that the pertussis vaccination does not fully protect children from whooping cough, that its effectiveness does not even reach into early childhood, and that vaccinated children act as a &ldquo;quiet reservoir&rdquo; of infection in current society.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that 93% of doctors know that the Ministry of Health recommends vaccinating pregnant women for flu and whooping cough, only 70% follow these guidelines. A third of doctors believe that both vaccinations are dangerous, or that their safety is questionable. 40% of doctors from those who believe that these vaccinations are dangerous, still recommend them to their patients.

  <span class="font-italic">2012, Baron-Epel, Vaccine</span>
</h6>

<p>After Israeli nurses were asked to vaccinate against whooping cough at 3 months, only 2% (two percent) deigned to do so. And we are talking about nurses working in mother and child centers (tipat halav), that is, those whose main role is to vaccinate children.<br>
Most nurses do not trust health authorities, and desperately resist compulsory vaccinations.<br>
They believe that parents should have the choice to vaccinate a child or not, and they demand the same respect for their rights.<br>
Nurses share work and personal life. The fact that their work is to inculcate children is one thing. And whether they are vaccinated themselves or not, it is their own business, and they do not consider it necessary to inform parents of their opinion about vaccinations, or whether they themselves are vaccinated.<br>
The authors of the study concluded that the nurses who do the vaccinations are, in fact, anti-vaccinations. (Israel)</p>
<p>This is probably the most important study of all presented here. In almost all other studies, data was collected from surveys of doctors. Doctors perfectly understand that they should not negatively react about vaccinations, therefore it is logical to assume that the real number of doctors who do not vaccinate their children is much higher. The data in this study is real, they are not based on surveys. 98% of nurses whose main role is to vaccinate children refuse to be vaccinated themselves!<br>
Israeli doctors, however, also <a href="https://www.vesty.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5028846,00.html">refuse</a> to be vaccinated against the flu.</p>

<p>There is a complete medical consensus on that natural immunity against tetanus is impossible, and only a vaccine can prevent the disease.<br>
The authors ran blood tests of two hundred randomly selected immigrants from Ethiopia to Israel and found tetanus antibodies in 98% of them. 30% of them had the level of antibodies that is considered protective (above 0.01 UI/ml). None of them have been vaccinated.<br>
The amount of antibodies increased with age. The authors concluded that natural immunity is produced from continuous contact with the bacteria.</p>

Many of them were not fully vaccinated (from 6% among the young to 68% among the elderly).</p>
