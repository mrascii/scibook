<p>Most people assume that a vaccine is just a weakened or killed virus/bacteria. The immune system produces antibodies for the injected killed virus, and subsequently, if the person becomes infected – his immune system can already recognize the virus and react quickly to it.<br />
This description is simplified to such extent that one might argue that it is completely untrue.</p>

<p>If everything were that simple, then the vaccine would provide a lifelong immunity, which is what happens after getting the actual disease. However, this is not what happens. Immunity obtained from a vaccine usually lasts 3-5 years. The most effective vaccines give immunity for 10-20 year. (What exactly is meant by the word ‘immunity’ in the context of vaccination is a separate topic, which will be discussed in another section).<br />
Our immune system is not stupid. It understands that the fragment of a killed virus or bacterium does not pose any real danger and thus <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3117407" target="_blank">produces</a> antibodies against it very poorly.<br />
How do the smart scientists solve this problem? They add an adjuvant to the vaccine. <strong>An adjuvant</strong> is a molecule, which the immune system recognizes as a very toxic one and reacts strongly to. In addition, the immune system reacts to the virus as well and, to make things worse, it also reacts to all the other vaccine ingredients, and not just to them. This, in turn, leads to allergies and various autoimmune diseases. This is why immunologists call aluminum the ‘immunologist’s dirty little secret.’<br />
There are vaccine ingredients such as egg whites (ovalbumin), for example. When the immune system learns to recognize the virus as a threat, it could easily consider ovalbumin to be dangerous as well, which could <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM195204032461403" target="_blank">lead</a> to egg allergies.<br />
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1964/09/19/peanut-oil-used-in-a-new-vaccine.html" target="_blank">Peanut oil in vaccines</a> might have caused the widespread allergy to peanuts.<br />
Squalene, the other vaccine adjuvant, is also produced in human tissue, and the immune response to it is probably what <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12127050" target="_blank">causes</a> autoimmune diseases.</p>

  <li>
    <section class="article">
      
<p>The second, and probably even more important reason for using adjuvants is purely economic.<br />
Growing viruses is difficult, time consuming and expensive. Perhaps, if significant amount of virus were injected, the immune system would respond to it appropriately and produce antibodies. It would, however, be a much more expensive vaccine. It is much cheaper to take a small amount of the virus, add some adjuvant and get a strong immune reaction. When getting an FDA approval, vaccine’s effectiveness is much more important than its safety. Safety, as we’ve seen, is fairly easy to fake. Faking effectiveness is much harder.</p>

<p>The two most common adjuvants are aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate. Dealing with just these two is enough to exclude most vaccines.<br />
The topic of aluminum is worth understanding even unrelated to vaccination, just to understand how corrupt science, WHO, CDC and the governments of different countries are.<br />
There are hundreds of studies proving that aluminum, even in minimal concentrations, is very toxic. I will only cite a few review articles.</p>

</h6>

<p>Despite the fact that aluminum adjuvants have been used in vaccines for 90 years, it is still unknown why and how exactly aluminum causes such a strong immune response.<br />
High toxicity and danger of aluminum consumed orally has been known since 1911 – when Dr William Gies published the results of seven years of research on aluminum in baking powder, preservatives and food coloring. Aluminum affects memory, concentration and behavior. (Aluminum is still used in baking powder and food preservatives).<br />
Premature babies that were given formula containing aluminum developed worse than babies given formula without aluminum.<br />
Aluminum that is used in kidney dialysis leads to dementia, seizures, psychosis, etc.<br />
Aluminum is also associated with the Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, ASD and epilepsy.<br />
The amount of aluminum in vaccines is dozens of times higher than the standards set by the FDA.<br />
The article is worth reading in full.</p>

<p>The amount of aluminum in vaccines is based on effectiveness, ignoring body weight when determining the safe level.<br />
Conclusion on the safety of the amount of aluminum in vaccines was based solely on the studies of oral consumption effects on adult mice and rats.<br />
On their first day of life babies receive 17 times more aluminum than the set maximum level would be if the dosage were adjusted for body weight.</p>

<p>Even though this article is mainly about the role of aluminum in the Alzheimer’s disease, it also lists the currently known mechanisms of aluminum’s influence on biological processes.<br />
Despite the fact that aluminum is one of the most common metals on Earth, in nature it is found only in the compounds with silicon and oxygen. Men only learned how to produce pure aluminum and create aluminum salts in the late nineteenth century.<br />
Aluminum has no useful biological function.<br />
Aluminum is a strong neurotoxin, which inhibits more than 200 biological processes.<br />
Among other things, aluminum binds with ATP (which causes chronic fatigue), changes DNA, kills nerve cells, destroys the homeostasis of useful minerals, such as magnesium, calcium and iron, by mimicking them, etc.</p>

</h6>

<p>And here is a systematic review and meta-analysis, which proves that aluminum in DTP vaccines is safe. I highly recommend reading this articles in full. After doing so, you opinion of science will never be the same again.<br />
The authors identified 8 studies of aluminum adjuvants and did a meta-analysis of 5 of them.<br />
The safety studies lasted from 24 hours to 6 weeks. The only side effects these studies were looking for were crying, screaming, pain, fever, seizure and redness.<br />
The authors have concluded that although these studies were of very poor quality, there is no substitute for aluminum in vaccines. And even if the alternative were found, all the vaccines would need to be tested and patented again, which would put the vaccination programs worldwide in question.<br />
Then comes the final, shocking conclusion: “Despite the lack of qualitative evidence, we do not recommend conducting any further research on this topic.”<br />
This was the systematic review of all the current literature on the safety of aluminum in vaccines.<br />
No, not exactly. It was not just an ordinary systematic review. It was a systematic review by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_(organisation)" target="_blank">Cochrane</a>, the most respected medical science organization whose systematic reviews are recognized as being of the highest quality in the world. One could only imagine what the ordinary, lower quality systematic reviews look like.</p>

<p>Although the aluminum adjuvants have been used since 1926, what exactly happens to them after they are injected into a muscle is unknown to science.<br />
The researches took several rabbits and injected two of them with radioactive aluminum hydroxide, and the other two with aluminum phosphate. 28 days later the rabbits were killed and at that moment 94% of aluminum hydroxide and 78% of aluminum phosphate still remained in the rabbits’ bodies.<br />
The authors examined several internal organs and concluded that little aluminum accumulated in each of them. However, it is unclear how exactly they determined that there was only ‘little’ aluminum, since there was no control group of rabbits that were not injected with any kind of vaccine in the experiment. The authors have not examined the rabbits’ bones (because they damaged them), even though it is a known fact that aluminum accumulates in the bones. Neither did they examine the muscles that were injected with aluminum.<br />
The study only lasted 28 days, although it is known that aluminum stays in the body for years.<br />
The authors concluded that the body successfully disposes of aluminum, regardless of the fact that most of the aluminum remained in the body, and it is completely unclear in which organs particularly.</p>

<p>A very interesting review article, which analyzes all the published studies of safety of aluminum adjuvants.<br />
- Aluminum stimulates a humoral immune response and barely stimulates the cellular one;<br />
- The FDA approved amount of aluminum per vaccine dose (0.85 mg) was determined empirically based on the effectiveness of this dose;<br />
- Aforementioned study on rabbits is currently the only existing pharmacokinetic study on aluminum adjuvants on animals. Moreover, the adjuvants tested in this study differ from the adjuvants actually used in the vaccines;<br />
- FDA’s conclusion that aluminum in vaccines is safe is based on two theoretical articles, which are analyzed in detail here. The ‘safe dose’ of aluminum for babies was extrapolated from the studies on mice that received aluminum orally. The authors conclude that comparing the toxicity of aluminum ions absorbed orally with the toxicity of aluminum salts administered intramuscularly is nonsense.

<p>Three groups of mice were injected with different doses of aluminum hydroxide (200, 400 and 800 mg/kg of weight). The experiment showed that aluminum granulomas only formed in the muscles of the mice that received high doses. The mice that got small doses did not have granulomas, but the aluminum reached their brains and they had psycho-physiological disorders. The concentration of aluminum in the brains of the group that received 200 μg/kg was 50 times higher then that of the control group. The authors conclude that the simplified toxicity model, according to which the level of toxicity depends on the dose, does not work in case of the aluminum hydroxide.</p>

<p>Sheep were divided into three groups. The first group received 19 vaccines with aluminum in the course of 15 months. The other group received injections of aluminum adjuvant only. The third one was the control group and received saline solution. 100% of the vaccinated and 92% of those injected with adjuvant had granulomas develop at the injection sites; the vaccinated ones had significantly more granulomas. The aluminum particles in granulomas of those vaccinated were much longer than of those injected with adjuvant. The fact that in the presence of an antigen the aluminum particles might increase in size is known from other studies.<br />
The concentration of aluminum in lymph nodes of the vaccinated ones was 32 times higher than of those who only received an adjuvant, and 86 times higher than of the control group.<br />
The authors conclude that aluminum gets to the lymph nodes through macrophages. Degenerative changes were observed in macrophages of both groups.<br />
Vaccinated sheep <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30395948" target="_blank">demonstrated</a> asocial, repetitive and aggressive behavior, and bit the wool of other, peacefully grazing sheep. The levels of cortisol were elevated in both vaccinated sheep and sheep that received the adjuvant. The behavioral changes were more pronounced in the vaccinated group that in the group that only received the adjuvant.<br />
The authors conducted this study, because the sheep often had autoimmune diseases in response to vaccination.</p>

<p>Different types of adjuvants are analyzed here.<br />
- One of the adjuvants used in vaccines is calcium phosphate. It has properties similar to those of the aluminum adjuvants, but since it is a molecule natural for the body, it does not cause neurological reactions and does not lead to allergic reactions.<br />
- The cost of developing new adjuvants is exorbitantly high, and if the costs of developing vaccines justify themselves, the costs for developing adjuvants do not.<br />
- If aluminum has not been used in vaccines for all these years, most likely it would not be allowed for use today for safety reasons.</p>

<p>Aluminum salts induce cell death and inflammation, which could explain why granulomas might form at the injection site.<br />
Aluminum adjuvants induce a shift in the immune response towards Th2 and the production of IgE, which increases the risk of developing allergies and anaphylactic reactions.<br />
In cats, dogs and ferrets, aluminum adjuvants cause granulomas that can progress into malignant fibrosarcomas. It is unknown why such tumors do not develop in humans.<br />
It is also unknown how cumulative doses of aluminum adjuvants contribute to the development of chronic diseases such as Alzheimer’s or chronic bone disease.<br />
Aluminum and squalene adjuvants cause serious side effects in animals. Even though its relevance to humans in unknown, this data is still ignored when determining the adjuvant safety for new vaccines. For example, it has been known for many years now that squalene can lead to autoimmune diseases in susceptible animals. Consequently, the consumer may reasonably ask if this data indicates the possibility of developing autoimmune diseases in susceptible humans. There is currently no good answer to this question.<br />
The author concludes that we know very little about the toxicity of adjuvants.</p>

<p>His arguments:<br />
1) Aluminum adjuvants are safe, because they have been used in vaccines for over 70 years;<br />
2) There’s aluminum in breast milk, baby formula, and in general – it is one of the most common metals;<br />
3) There were experiments done on mice, when they were fed aluminum lactate and nothing happened to them.<br />
The first argument is so ridiculous and anti-scientific that it is difficult to respond to it. 70 years ago half of the children did not have chronic diseases. And given the abundance of scientific research on the dangers of aluminum, this argument is simply false.<br />
The following article responds to the second argument:</p>

<p>Even one single Hepatitis B vaccine, which the baby gets on their first day of life, has 5 times more aluminum than they would get from 6 months of breastfeeding.<br />
Moreover, it is impossible to compare aluminum and aluminum adjuvant, which is bound to the antigen, and which is much harder for the body to dispose of.<br />
The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2156888" target="_blank">aforementioned article</a> from the 6th paragraph responds to the third argument. Offit fails to mention that the motor activity of 20% of mice from this experiment was significantly impaired. Not to mention that comparing intramuscular aluminum and aluminum in food (only 0.25% of which is absorbed) is impossible, just like comparing aluminum lactate with aluminum phosphate or aluminum hydroxide. Different aluminum salts have different toxicity.</p>

Adults consume most of the aluminum with hot drinks (except coffee) and vegetables (except potato); children also consume it with pasta and confectionary; and babies get it from the formulas, which contain hundreds of times more aluminum than cow milk. Other sources of aluminum are dishes, packaging, antacids and analgesics.<br />
Acid rains lower the pH of the soil, increasing the solubility of aluminum, and from such soil aluminum gets into water, plants and animals.</p>

<p>Mineral water rich in silica Si(OH)<sub>4</sub> removes aluminum from the body.<br />
12 weeks of drinking this water led to cognitive improvements in some Alzheimer’s patients.<br />
Judging by experiments on rats, curcumin might <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22130689" target="_blank">protect</a> from the inflammatory effects of aluminum, and also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27055897" target="_blank">omega-3</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28128384" target="_blank">mung bean extract</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28397152" target="_blank">moringa</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26374992" target="_blank">melatonin</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25690328" target="_blank">olive oil</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28119228" target="_blank">folic acid</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19425234" target="_blank">propolis</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28523611" target="_blank">lecitin</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23219369" target="_blank">selenium</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24770980" target="_blank">taurine</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16545059" target="_blank">viramin E</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22918785" target="_blank">quercetin</a>.

<p>Removing aluminum by chelation therapy in multiple sclerosis patients led to improvement of their symptoms. Patients with neuro-degenerative diseases and multiple sclerosis have much higher levels of aluminum than healthy people.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=933TYSOglZE" target="_blank">L&rsquo;aluminium, les vaccines et les deux lapins</a> (Aluminum, vaccines and two rabbits)<br />
A very interesting French film ( with English subtitles.) Includes interviews with world expert on aluminum Cristopher Exley, as well as with MMF (Gherardi and Authier) discoverers.For corruption and much more.<br />
There are no less effective adjuvants (calcium phosphate) that are not used.<br />
- There are vaccines generally without adjuvants, they are no longer used.</p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/215109690" target="_blank">Vaccine syndrome</a><br />
This film is also part of the series Vaccines revealed.<br />
250,000 soldiers participating in the Gulf War suffer from the Gulf War syndrome (Gulf War Syndrome), representing 35% of all soldiers participating in it, and suffering from soldiers who did not take part in the fighting, and more than a million American soldiers suffer from the Gulf War syndrome .The reason for this appears to be an experimental vaccine from anthrax (anthrax), as well as other vaccines that US soldiers are required to do in large kits The American soldier who refused to be vaccinated goes to court, then goes to jail for a couple of months, gets a big fine, and then he is fired, depriving him of titles and pensions (dishonorable discharge).<br />
35,000 soldiers died of the side effects of vaccination Anthrax: By comparison, less than 6,800 soldiers were killed in Iraq and Afghanistan (it&rsquo;s unclear where they got that number from). - And where do the Iraqis have the anthrax, which the Americans were so afraid of? His Saddam Hussein was given President Jimmy Carter to help him in his war with Iran.<br />
Soldiers vaccinated from anthrax gave birth to children with severe birth defects.<br />
22 veterans commit suicide every day. (I often heard this fact, but did not imagine that it could be somehow related to vaccinations.)<br />
And remember the envelopes with anthrax, which a week after 9/11 were sent to senators and news agencies, resulting in 5 people were killed, and then Iraq and Al Qaeda were accused? The FBI <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_anthrax_attacks" target="_blank">believes</a> that they were sent by a scientist who worked in the US Army over an anthrax vaccine.</p>

<p>Aluminum, it turns out, is also used in drinking water purification systems, and some of it the quantities stay in the water. I highly recommend watching this movie.</p>
