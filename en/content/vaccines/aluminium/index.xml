      <description>Most people assume that a vaccine is just a weakened or killed virus/bacteria. The immune system produces antibodies for the injected killed virus, and subsequently, if the person becomes infected – his immune system can already recognize the virus and react quickly to it.
This description is simplified to such extent that one might argue that it is completely untrue.</description>

      <description>If everything were that simple, then the vaccine would provide a lifelong immunity, which is what happens after getting the actual disease. However, this is not what happens. Immunity obtained from a vaccine usually lasts 3-5 years. The most effective vaccines give immunity for 10-20 year. (What exactly is meant by the word ‘immunity’ in the context of vaccination is a separate topic, which will be discussed in another section).</description>

      <description>The second, and probably even more important reason for using adjuvants is purely economic.
Growing viruses is difficult, time consuming and expensive. Perhaps, if significant amount of virus were injected, the immune system would respond to it appropriately and produce antibodies. It would, however, be a much more expensive vaccine. It is much cheaper to take a small amount of the virus, add some adjuvant and get a strong immune reaction.</description>

      <description>The two most common adjuvants are aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate. Dealing with just these two is enough to exclude most vaccines.
The topic of aluminum is worth understanding even unrelated to vaccination, just to understand how corrupt science, WHO, CDC and the governments of different countries are.
There are hundreds of studies proving that aluminum, even in minimal concentrations, is very toxic. I will only cite a few review articles.</description>

      <description>The question of the safety of aluminum salts is one of the cornerstone questions with regard to vaccination safety and thus vaccination advocates have to answer it often.
Here, for example, is an article by Paul Offit, the most famous vaccination advocate, in which he explains to the parents that aluminum in vaccines should not be feared:</description>

      <description>The topic of antiperspirants (deodorants containing aluminum) is quite controversial, as is any other topic where a lot of money is involved. There is still no clear evidence that antiperspirants cause breast cancer. However, here is an example of an article that every woman should read and then decide for herself whether there is enough reason to assume that the connection between antiperspirants and breast cancer is highly probable, and if she should take part in this experiment, or perhaps, it would be better not to risk it.</description>

      <description>L&amp;rsquo;aluminium, les vaccines et les deux lapins (Aluminum, vaccines and two rabbits)
A very interesting French film ( with English subtitles.) Includes interviews with world expert on aluminum Cristopher Exley, as well as with MMF (Gherardi and Authier) discoverers.For corruption and much more.
There are no less effective adjuvants (calcium phosphate) that are not used.
- There are vaccines generally without adjuvants, they are no longer used.</description>

      <description>Vaccine syndrome
This film is also part of the series Vaccines revealed.
250,000 soldiers participating in the Gulf War suffer from the Gulf War syndrome (Gulf War Syndrome), representing 35% of all soldiers participating in it, and suffering from soldiers who did not take part in the fighting, and more than a million American soldiers suffer from the Gulf War syndrome .The reason for this appears to be an experimental vaccine from anthrax (anthrax), as well as other vaccines that US soldiers are required to do in large kits The American soldier who refused to be vaccinated goes to court, then goes to jail for a couple of months, gets a big fine, and then he is fired, depriving him of titles and pensions (dishonorable discharge).</description>

      <title>Addressing Parents&#39; Concerns: Do Vaccines Contain Harmful Preservatives, Adjuvants, Additives, or Residuals?</title>

      <description>His arguments:
1) Aluminum adjuvants are safe, because they have been used in vaccines for over 70 years;
2) There’s aluminum in breast milk, baby formula, and in general – it is one of the most common metals;
3) There were experiments done on mice, when they were fed aluminum lactate and nothing happened to them.
The first argument is so ridiculous and anti-scientific that it is difficult to respond to it.</description>

      <description>And here is a systematic review and meta-analysis, which proves that aluminum in DTP vaccines is safe. I highly recommend reading this articles in full. After doing so, you opinion of science will never be the same again.
The authors identified 8 studies of aluminum adjuvants and did a meta-analysis of 5 of them.
The safety studies lasted from 24 hours to 6 weeks. The only side effects these studies were looking for were crying, screaming, pain, fever, seizure and redness.</description>

      <description>Analysis of the amount of aluminum in different products.
There is a lot of aluminum in frozen pizzas, sausages, cheese, pancakes, baking powder, baking mixes, etc.
There is also much aluminum in beverages served in aluminum beer cans.
Rats that have been given drinks from aluminum cans had 69% more aluminum in their bones.
There is much aluminum in chocolate, very much in cacao, as well as tea and fruit juices.</description>

      <description>Despite the fact that aluminum adjuvants have been used in vaccines for 90 years, it is still unknown why and how exactly aluminum causes such a strong immune response.
High toxicity and danger of aluminum consumed orally has been known since 1911 – when Dr William Gies published the results of seven years of research on aluminum in baking powder, preservatives and food coloring. Aluminum affects memory, concentration and behavior. (Aluminum is still used in baking powder and food preservatives).</description>

      <description>Aluminum in antiperspirants blocks the sweat glands preventing them from releasing sweat, which is what makes them so effective.
 The cause of 90% of breast cancer is environmental, not genetic.
 In 1926 only 31% of cancer tumors were located in upper outer part of the breast. In 1994 the numbers increased to 61%. This proportion is growing linearly each year.
 Genomic instability in outer part of the breast is constantly increasing.</description>

      <description>Aluminum salts induce cell death and inflammation, which could explain why granulomas might form at the injection site.
Aluminum adjuvants induce a shift in the immune response towards Th2 and the production of IgE, which increases the risk of developing allergies and anaphylactic reactions.
In cats, dogs and ferrets, aluminum adjuvants cause granulomas that can progress into malignant fibrosarcomas. It is unknown why such tumors do not develop in humans.</description>

      <description>The more vaccinations containing aluminum are given in the country, the more children with ASD there are.
The increase in the number of children with ASD in the US correlates with the increase in the number of aluminum adjuvants used. (r = 0.92, p&amp;lt;0.0001)
The authors use Hill’s criteria and conclude that the relationship between aluminum in vaccines and ASD is probably causal. This article is also worth reading in full.</description>

      <description>A very interesting review article, which analyzes all the published studies of safety of aluminum adjuvants.
- Aluminum stimulates a humoral immune response and barely stimulates the cellular one;
- The FDA approved amount of aluminum per vaccine dose (0.85 mg) was determined empirically based on the effectiveness of this dose;
- Aforementioned study on rabbits is currently the only existing pharmacokinetic study on aluminum adjuvants on animals. Moreover, the adjuvants tested in this study differ from the adjuvants actually used in the vaccines;</description>

      <description>Sheep were divided into three groups. The first group received 19 vaccines with aluminum in the course of 15 months. The other group received injections of aluminum adjuvant only. The third one was the control group and received saline solution. 100% of the vaccinated and 92% of those injected with adjuvant had granulomas develop at the injection sites; the vaccinated ones had significantly more granulomas. The aluminum particles in granulomas of those vaccinated were much longer than of those injected with adjuvant.</description>

      <description>38% of orally consumed aluminum accumulates in the intestinal mucosa.
Even though the intestines absorb only a small amount of aluminum, 2% of aluminum entering the blood remains in the body and accumulates with age.
Aluminum is probably associated with inflammatory bowel disease.
Adults consume most of the aluminum with hot drinks (except coffee) and vegetables (except potato); children also consume it with pasta and confectionary; and babies get it from the formulas, which contain hundreds of times more aluminum than cow milk.</description>

      <description>0.83% of children vaccinated with Infanrix had aluminum granulomas form at the injection site. 85% of them became allergic to aluminum. Two vaccines with aluminum doubled the risk of granuloma.
57% of the children had itchy granulomas form 2 weeks to 13 month after the vaccination; they disappeared after 22 month on average.
0.98% of vaccinated children had granulomas form, and 95% of them became allergies to aluminum – another study shows.</description>

      <description>Although the aluminum adjuvants have been used since 1926, what exactly happens to them after they are injected into a muscle is unknown to science.
The researches took several rabbits and injected two of them with radioactive aluminum hydroxide, and the other two with aluminum phosphate. 28 days later the rabbits were killed and at that moment 94% of aluminum hydroxide and 78% of aluminum phosphate still remained in the rabbits’ bodies.</description>

      <description>Even one single Hepatitis B vaccine, which the baby gets on their first day of life, has 5 times more aluminum than they would get from 6 months of breastfeeding.
Moreover, it is impossible to compare aluminum and aluminum adjuvant, which is bound to the antigen, and which is much harder for the body to dispose of.
The aforementioned article from the 6th paragraph responds to the third argument. Offit fails to mention that the motor activity of 20% of mice from this experiment was significantly impaired.</description>

      <description>Even though this article is mainly about the role of aluminum in the Alzheimer’s disease, it also lists the currently known mechanisms of aluminum’s influence on biological processes.
Despite the fact that aluminum is one of the most common metals on Earth, in nature it is found only in the compounds with silicon and oxygen. Men only learned how to produce pure aluminum and create aluminum salts in the late nineteenth century.</description>

      <description>A review article about Macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF). In some patients, the aluminum adjuvants do not dissolve after the vaccination, but rather remain at the injection site and form an aluminum granuloma. Accompanying symptoms are usually myalgia (muscle pains), chronic fatigue, cognitive impairment, as well as various autoimmune diseases.</description>

      <description>Three groups of mice were injected with different doses of aluminum hydroxide (200, 400 and 800 mg/kg of weight). The experiment showed that aluminum granulomas only formed in the muscles of the mice that received high doses. The mice that got small doses did not have granulomas, but the aluminum reached their brains and they had psycho-physiological disorders. The concentration of aluminum in the brains of the group that received 200 μg/kg was 50 times higher then that of the control group.</description>

      <description>The amount of aluminum in vaccines is based on effectiveness, ignoring body weight when determining the safe level.
Conclusion on the safety of the amount of aluminum in vaccines was based solely on the studies of oral consumption effects on adult mice and rats.
On their first day of life babies receive 17 times more aluminum than the set maximum level would be if the dosage were adjusted for body weight.</description>

      <description>Aluminum, administered intramuscularly along with the vaccine, gets into the brain, spleen, liver, and remains there for years. It is transported through the body by macrophages.
Macrophages are the cells that devour bacteria and other toxic substances. Macrophages swallow aluminum, but do not know how to dispose of it, and spread it throughout the body through the lymphatic system.
Here are two more review and educational articles on aluminum adjuvants, which are worth reading: [1] [2]</description>

      <description>Different types of adjuvants are analyzed here.
- One of the adjuvants used in vaccines is calcium phosphate. It has properties similar to those of the aluminum adjuvants, but since it is a molecule natural for the body, it does not cause neurological reactions and does not lead to allergic reactions.
- The cost of developing new adjuvants is exorbitantly high, and if the costs of developing vaccines justify themselves, the costs for developing adjuvants do not.</description>
