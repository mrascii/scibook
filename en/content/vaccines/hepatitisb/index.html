<p>As is HPV, hepatitis B is a virus, which is most commonly spread through sexual contact or through the blood. If the mother is infected with hepatitis B, the virus can pass to the baby through the placenta, or during delivery.

<p>80% of the infected adults show no symptoms or very mild ones, and they do not even know that they have been ill. After having been infected they get lifelong immunity.<br />
Of the remaining 20% of those diagnosed with hepatitis B, 95% recover fully and get lifelong immunity.<br />
Of the remaining 5%, only 25% (that is 0.25% of all those infected) will develop cirrhosis of the liver or cancer in 20-30 years after the infection. This cirrhosis or cancer does not develop because of the virus itself, but rather because of the immune response to it.<br />
70% of patients with hepatitis B are drug addicts, gay people, alcoholics, homeless people and people with many sexual partners.<br />

<p>Three doses of the vaccine are usually given: immediately after birth, at one and six months old. This is the only vaccine that is given immediately after delivery. It is not done to prevent the possibility of contracting the infection from the mother. In the USA and other countries, all women get tested for hepatitis B before childbirth. Children of infected mothers receive immunoglobulin (antibodies) together with the vaccine.<br />
In some countries, however, all children get vaccinated just <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0272989X9301300103" target="_blank">because</a> it is much cheaper than testing all mothers.</p>

<p>Prior to the onset of the full vaccination of infants, in 1990, only 1 out of 100,000 children under the age of 15 had hepatitis B in the USA. Currently, the risk of getting infected with hepatitis B at any age under 20 years old <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2013surveillance/pdfs/2013hepsurveillancerpt.pdf" target="_blank">is</a> 0.3 in one million. In developed countries, hepatitis B is a rare disease. In Africa and Southeast Asia, it is much more common.</p>

<p>The first hepatitis B vaccine appeared in 1981. It was made with a live virus, and after its introduction, the number of people infected with hepatitis B <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/hepb.html" target="_blank">increased</a> rapidly. A 1994 study determined that despite the existence of the vaccine, the number of patients with hepatitis B was <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9987458" target="_blank">not decreasing</a>.</p>

<p>There are quite a few manufacturers of this vaccine, but in developed countries, Recombivax (Merck) and Engerix-B (GSK) are most commonly used, as well as combined vaccines.<br />
Engerix-B contains aluminum hydroxide, and Recombivax contains Amorphous Aluminum Hydroxyphosphate Sulfate (AAHS, the same adjuvant that Gardasil has). Recombivax has twice as much aluminum (500 µg vs. 250 µg). Previously, the Recombivax package insert indicated that it contains aluminum hydroxide. Now they put it this way: <em>0.5 mg of aluminum provided as aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate, previously referred to as aluminum hydroxide.</em> This goes to the question how trustworthy the list of vaccine ingredients is.<br />
Viruses for both vaccines are grown in yeast, which is why they contain 1% of yeast protein, which may well lead to a yeast allergy.</p>

  <span class="font-italic">2018,  Indian J Pediatr</span>
</h6>

<p>In India, where hepatitis B is quite common, there is no difference in the effectiveness of the vaccine if given at birth, or at the age of six weeks.<br />
The risk of chronic infection is 90% when infected at the age of less than one year, 30% if infected at the age of 1-5 years and 2% for adults.<br />
The incidence of hepatitis in India is 2.4%, which should result in 250,000 deaths from hepatocellular carcinoma. However, only 5,000 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma per year are recorded in India (0.02% of all deaths), which is much less than expected.<br />
At the age of one year, 45% of unvaccinated children had natural immunity against hepatitis B. By the age of 4-5 years the number of antibodies of vaccinated children decreased, and was only insignificantly higher than that of the unvaccinated children. The authors believe that unvaccinated children are probably protected by the mother’s antibodies, which disappear only years after birth, and not withn 9 months, as is commonly believed.<br />
The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in the USA began to <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1001683" target="_blank">rise</a> rapidly in the early 90s and by 2007 it already increased more than twofold.</p>

<p>Unlike with other vaccines, babies vaccinated against hepatitis B produce more antibodies than adults, but less interferon gamma. Meaning that the immune response in infants is biased towards the humoral immunity as compared to adults (see the chapter about whooping cough). The same was found with the oral polio vaccine.<br />
Revaccination in adults causes a cellular immunity response, whereas in infants it does not.<br />
Those who received BCG vaccine at birth together with hepatitis B vaccine had significantly more antibodies at the age of 12 months than those who received BCG at the age of 4.5 months.</p>

According to a statement by the Ministry of Health, it was recalled because the ampoules arrived on the machine that glued the labels too quickly, which could theoretically result in micro-cracks and bacterial contamination. the population was asked not to worry, but the vaccine was withdrawn.Two years have passed since then, but the vaccine did not return to the market, and probably could not solve the problem of sticking labels.</p>

<p>Sci-B-Vac is a third-generation vaccine, the first generation was a live vaccine, the second generation is a recombinant (genetically modified) vaccine containing virus-like particles. The third generation vaccine contains two more antigens, and therefore gives more <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8779530" target="_blank">strong</a> immune response.<br />
The only published clinical trial of the vaccine <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9194109" target="_blank">included</a> 150 children. The vaccine <a href="http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000865960" target="_blank">did not receive</a> a permission from the FDA. The Ministries of Health Committee report which allowed the vaccination in Israel, somewhere <a href="http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4690411,00.html" target="_blank">disappeared</a>.<br />
Many parents argue that the children because of this vaccination had strong side effects, developmental delays, etc. What is not very surprising, since it contained twice as much aluminum, in addition, it has three antigens instead of one, which further increases the risk of autoimmune reaction. Why this will be dismantled in another part.</p>

<p>How do the vaccination advocate argue the need for this vaccination for infants? Let’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hypTVwUo_IY" target="_blank">listen</a> to Paul Offit.<br />
His first argument is that the child can get infected from the mother while passing through the birth canal. In this case, however, the vaccine would be ineffective – the child needs immunoglobulin. In addition, all pregnant women in the USA are screened for hepatitis.<br />
The second argument is that the child can get infected from someone else’s toothbrush, or from some uncle. This way of contracting the infection is purely theoretical. There is not a single study proving that anyone has contracted hepatitis B this way.<br />
The third argument is that those who get the vaccine immediately after birth are more likely to finish the entire series of three vaccinations. No comments.</p>

<section class="summary"><p>Vaccinating children against hepatitis B only makes sense if you are planning on a career in prostitution for them, or if the child shows homosexual inclinations, or if you fear that the child will become a drug addict.<br />
And even then, it makes no sense to vaccinate newborns, but would be worth waiting till the age of 18 years. The probability of contracting hepatitis B before the start of sexual activity is virtually zero.<br />
The vaccine contains 250-550 μg of aluminum. That is, three doses of this vaccine contain 15-30 times more aluminum than all the aluminum the child will get from breast milk in six months. By the way, the fact that babies get aluminum from mother’s milk does not mean that it is normal. It means that mothers are poisoned with aluminum, which they get from food and water, and are poisoning their babies with it.<br />
The vaccine increases risk of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, arthritis, type 1 diabetes and others.</p>
