      <description>Mumps in children is usually so mild that even WHO does not scare anyone with it. In adults, however, they say that mumps can cause severe complications. Hence it is important to vaccinate infants.</description>

      <description>In 2010, two virologists, who had previously worked for Merck, sued the company. They claimed that Merck manipulated the results of the mumps vaccine clinical trial, which allowed the company to remain the exclusive MMR manufacturer in the United States.
The lawsuit states that Merck organized a fictitious vaccine-testing program in the late 90s. The company obliged the scientists to participate in the program, promising them all bonuses if the vaccine got certified, and threatening prison if they were to report this fraud to the FDA.</description>

      <description>Urabe strain had been used in Great Britain since 1988, and stopped being used in 1992, only after the manufacturers declared that they are stopping production. However, according to the published documents, authorities knew about the dangers of this strain in 1987 already.</description>

      <description>Here is the analysis of 2,482 cases of mumps hospitalization in 1958-1969 in 16 hospitals in England. They constitute the majority of mumps cases that required hospitalization in the country. Half of the patients were 15 years old or older. Complications were recorded in 42% of all cases. Three patients died, but two of them had another serious underlying illness and mumps might not have had anything to do with the death, and the third patient was most probably misdiagnosed and did not even have mumps.</description>

      <description>In pre-vaccination times, 15-27% of mumps cases were asymptomatic. The number of asymptomatic cases today is unknown, as it is unclear how the vaccine modifies clinical symptoms. Orchitis (testicular inflammation) is the most common complication of mumps, but it is only possible in post-pubertal males. Orchitis is primarily unilateral. Infertility caused by mumps orchitis is quite rare, even in cases of bilateral orchitis.
Prior to introduction of the vaccine, cases of mumps were not recorded.</description>

      <description>A 14 months old boy was given an MMR vaccine, and 4 months later he was diagnosed with a severe combined immunodeficiency. He then successfully underwent a bone marrow transplant, but developed chronic encephalitis, and died at the age of 5. A brain biopsy showed that he had the vaccine strain of the mumps virus in his brain. This was the first case of panencephalitis caused by the mumps virus.</description>

      <description>Unlike other types of cancer, whose risk increases with age, the risk of ovarian cancer increases till the age of 70, and then decreases sharply. The risk of ovarian cancer in Japan is much lower than in England and the US, where this type of cancer is becoming more common.
The authors analyzed the relationship between ovarian cancer and 50 different factors, and found that the only statistically significant factor associated with ovarian cancer was not having had mumps in childhood (p=0.</description>

      <description>The authors examined five types of live vaccines and detected bovine viral diarrhea virus RNA in MMR vaccines of two different manufacturers, as well as in two monovalent vaccines against mumps and rubella, which most likely got there from fetal bovine serum.
In infants, this virus might cause gastroenteritis, and in pregnant women, it might lead to the birth of children with microcephaly.</description>

      <description>In addition to these two, seven more studies have been published on the association of mumps with the reduced risk of ovarian cancer. Nonetheless, the biological mechanism of this phenomenon has not been studied, and with the beginning of vaccination the connection between mumps and ovarian cancer became irrelevant, and was forgotten.
All but two of the studies found the protective effect of mumps against ovarian cancer. One of the two studies, which did not find the connection, did not even find the connection between pregnancy and ovarian cancer.</description>

      <description>20 years after the invention of the vaccine and 10 years after it became widely used, the first mumps outbreak (118 cases) occurred in the workplace (Chicago Futures Exchange). Total costs associated with the outbreak amounted to $120,738, whereas the vaccine costs only $4.47.
The authors report that historically, vaccine prevention of mumps did not get as much attention as the other diseases, because it is a mild one. However, $1,500 per case of mumps is too expensive, when the vaccine only costs $4.</description>

      <description>Upon getting infected with mumps, polyfunctional memory T-cells are produced, but they are not produced upon vaccination. Perhaps this could explain why the vaccine only gives temporary immunity.</description>

      <description>Here is the report of 119 cases of meningoencephalitis caused by mumps in San Francisco in 12 years (1943-1955). Most cases are mild, with no complications, no neurological consequences, last less than 5 days, and rarely require hospitalization. Death due to mumps meningoencephalitis is a very rare phenomenon, and in the entire medical literature only 3 such cases have been described (including one out of these 119).</description>

      <description>A mumps outbreak in Israel (over 5,000 cases). 78% had been fully vaccinated. Mostly teenagers and adults got sick. In other countries (Austria, USA, Netherlands, Great Britain) mumps outbreaks were also observed among teenagers and college students, whereas in countries where there is no vaccination against mumps, children aged 5-9 years got sick.
Despite the high vaccination coverage (90-97%), mumps antibodies were found in only 68% of the population.
The authors report that the recent mumps outbreaks have been caused by the genotype G virus, whereas the vaccine contains genotype A.</description>

      <description>Mumps outbreak in a school where all but one of the students had been vaccinated. 54 cases in total.
There are many similar studies on mumps outbreaks among fully vaccinated. Here are a few more:
[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14].
The vaccine against mumps is so ineffective, and the outbreaks among fully vaccinated are so common, that there is a special article on Wikipedia, listing all the mumps outbreaks in the 21st century.</description>

      <description>Ovarian cancer is the fourth leading cause of death among American women. 25 thousand women get diagnosed each year, and 16 thousand of them die. The authors analyzed three viruses: a recombinant measles virus and vaccine strains of mumps and measles, as treatment for ovarian cancer in vitro on mice. All three viruses successfully killed cancer cells. Despite the excellent results, they did not start using the virus as part of the conventional cancer therapy.</description>

      <description>The following year, learning from their mistakes, the Brazilian authorities bought MMR with another strain of mumps (Leningrad-Zagreb) and vaccinated 845 thousand children with it. Another outbreak of aseptic meningitis started, and this time the risk of disease was 74 times higher. Sure, it was known that this strain also increases the risk of meningitis, but since the vaccination campaign in the Bahamas did not cause a meningitis outbreak, they decided to see how it would turn out in Brazil.</description>

      <description>After the mass MMR vaccination campaign in Brazil with the Japanese strain of mumps (Urabe), an outbreak of aseptic meningitis began. The risk of disease increased by 14-30 times.
The fact that Urabe strain is associated with aseptic meningitis was already known, but Brazilian authorities decided to use this strain anyway, as it is cheaper and more effective than the Jeryl Lynn strain (which is used in the US), and because they thought the risk of meningitis was quite low.</description>

      <description>Clinical mumps in childhood is associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer. Moreover, it turned out that patients with ovarian cancer had less mumps antibodies.
The authors believe that what influences the risk of ovarian cancer is not the actual mumps infection, but rather the subclinical course of the disease. In case of the subclinical disease (without symptoms, like after vaccination) less antibodies are produced, which is what subsequently protects against cancer.</description>

      <description>13 years later, BMJ wonders again whether the UK needs yet another vaccine for infants.
Mumps is not subject to registration, thus the number of cases is unknown, especially since 40% of mumps cases are asymptomatic. Perhaps a combination vaccine with measles is justifiable. This vaccine could be given to children when they start school, for those who have not yet had mumps or measles.
Would the 50% of parents, who agree to the measles vaccine today, agree to another vaccine in addition to it?</description>

      <description>All three of the previous studies were conducted in Japan, and the results were of no interest to anyone outside the country. Then, in 2016, the notorious Mayo Clinic decided to take samples of this virus from Japan and test them in vitro and on mice. It turned out that indeed, the virus has an anti-cancer effect.</description>

      <description>Here is the description of 9 cases of deafness after the MMR vaccine within four years of vaccination. The authors conclude that in 3 cases deafness was unrelated to the vaccine (but they do not provide an explanation for this conclusion), and in 6 other cases it may or may not have been related to the vaccine.
Since unilateral deafness is hard to diagnose in children, and they get vaccinated at the age of 12 months, there may have been other cases that were missed.</description>

      <description>Among the 18-29 years age group in Czech Republic, only 19% of those vaccinated against mumps had antibodies. Among the unvaccinated of the same age group, 48% had antibodies.
Among those unvaccinated aged 40 years and over, 63% has mumps immunity.
Despite the vaccination coverage of 98%, mumps outbreaks in Czech Republic did not stop, but rather the incidence of mumps shifted to the older age group.</description>

      <description>Two hundred cancer patients got intravenous injections of mumps virus (Urabe strain). The only side effect was a slight fever in half of the patients.
In 26 patients regression of the tumor was observed. In majority of the patients the pain was alleviated. In 30 out of 35 patients, the bleeding decreased or stopped. In 30 out of 41 patients, ascites and swelling decreased or disappeared.</description>

      <description>Mumps outbreak in London. 51% of the patients had been vaccinated. The effectiveness of one dose of the vaccine is 64%. The effectiveness of two doses – 88%. This effectiveness is much lower than is stated in clinical trials, since immunogenicity (i.e. the amount of antibodies) is not an accurate biological marker of the vaccine effectiveness. Moreover, the vaccines might have been improperly stored, which could have caused them to lose their effectiveness.</description>

      <description>One of the MMR components (and some other vaccines) is fetal bovine serum. Cells, in which the virus is grown, need to multiply. To do so, they need a nutrient medium with hormones, growth factors, proteins, amino acids, vitamins, etc. Fetal bovine serum is usually used as this medium. Since the serum should preferably be sterile, the blood of calves&amp;rsquo; fetuses is used instead of the cow’s blood.
A pregnant cow is killed and the uterus is removed.</description>

      <description>90 patients in terminal stage of cancer tried the mumps virus treatment (wild or almost wild strain). The virus was given orally, rectally, intravenously, by inhalation, by local injection, or simply by applying externally to the tumor. Since the researchers did not have enough virus, patients received only small amounts.
37 patients demonstrated very good results (the tumor disappeared completely or shrank by more than 50%), 42 patients had good results (the tumor shrank or stopped growing).</description>

      <description>Mumps is a relatively mild childhood disease, but it is inconvenient, since children have to miss school. Severe mumps complications are rare.
Significantly fewer antibodies are formed after vaccination than after the disease.
Despite the fact that recently released mumps vaccine looks promising, there is no need for mass vaccination.</description>

      <description>The fact that fetal bovine serum is infected with the bovine viral diarrhea virus was known already in 1977. It is known that this virus passes through placenta and can infect the calf fetus in the uterus. 60% of serum samples in Australia were contaminated with the virus. 8% of the vaccines against Bovine Rhinotracheitis were also contaminated.
The virus was also found in bovine kidney cells, which are used in production of measles vaccine.</description>

      <description>In 2013, 15 mumps outbreaks were registered in France. 72% of the cases had been vaccinated twice. The effectiveness of the vaccine was 49% for one dose and 55% for two doses.
Among those who had been vaccinated once, the risk of getting mumps increased by 7% for every year that had passed since the vaccination.
Among those who had been vaccinated twice, the risk of getting mumps increased by 10% for every year that had passed after the second dose.</description>
