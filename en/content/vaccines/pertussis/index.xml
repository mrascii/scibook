      <description>Pertussis is caused by a bacterium, Bordetella pertussis, that settles in the airways of the respiratory tract. While the bacterium itself is not so dangerous, it secretes a toxin known as the pertussis toxin. This toxin irritates the respiratory tract and results in the release of mucus, ultimately leading to a severe cough with a characteristic sound (whoop). The cough can last for weeks, the reason why the Japanese and Chinese call this disease the &amp;ldquo;100-day cough&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Pertussis is transmitted exclusively through airborne droplets. As such, you can only become infected if you come close to a sick person (a distance of less than 2-3 meters). Outside a person, this bacterium dies very quickly.</description>

      <description>Since the 1950s, not a single vaccine against pertussis has been manufactured. Instead, it is always administered as part of a combined vaccine that also includes diphtheria and tetanus. This vaccine, DTP, is a whole-cell pertussis vaccine (plus diphtheria and tetanus). This means that it contains whole bacteria, which have been killed with formalin. While this vaccine has not been used in developed countries since 2001 because of its reactogenicity, it is still used throughout the rest of the world.</description>

      <description>All of the aforementioned pertussis vaccines contain aluminium, ranging from 330 μg in Daptacel to 1,500 μg in Pentacel. In addition, most of the pertussis vaccines also contain polysorbate 80 (previously discussed in the chapter on the papilloma vaccine). Moreover, the DTP vaccine, apart from containing 1,250 μg of aluminium, it also contains 25 μg of mercury.</description>

      <description>This is an example of doctors refusing to diagnose whooping cough among vaccinated individuals. A mother repeatedly took her two children to various doctors in Australia as they both presented classic pertussis symptoms. However, all doctors refused to check the children for whooping cough and paid no attention to the mother. After two months of symptoms however, the children were finally tested and it turned out that they indeed had whooping cough.</description>

      <description>As mentioned above, there is a &amp;ldquo;new definition of whooping cough&amp;rdquo; as notified by the World Health Organization. When a new vaccine appears on the market, the definition of a disease usually changes. For example, while before 1991 it was necessary to hear the characteristic cough, detect the presence of antibodies, or detect the presence of the pertussis bacteria to diagnose pertussis, after 1991 (when the clinical studies of the acellular vaccine began), these observations were no longer sufficient; it became necessary that the cough last for at least three weeks.</description>

      <description>As the pertussis vaccine is extremely inefficient, and whooping cough can be very dangerous, primarily for infants, scientists from the CDC decided that as soon as a new baby was born into a family, the entire family should be vaccinated. They recommended that mothers, fathers, siblings, and grandparents, as well as everyone else who comes into contact with the child, should be vaccinated in order to create a cocoon around the child.</description>

      <description>As cocooning is not very effective, the CDC has recommended since 2011 that all pregnant women be vaccinated against pertussis during the third trimester. This is so that the antibodies against pertussis can be passed on to the foetus through the placenta. The CDC does not mention the fact that aluminium also passes through the placenta. Many women complain that they started contractions right after vaccination, and that the vaccination led to premature birth, but according to studies, they just think that the vaccination accelerated the birth.</description>

      <description>We try not to delve too deeply into biology, but in order to realize the absurdity of vaccination against whooping cough, we need to understand a little how the immune system works. Let´s consider leprosy, a disease for which there is no vaccine. Leprosy, roughly speaking, can be of two kinds - tuberculoid or lepromatous. Tuberculoid leprosy is a relatively mild form of the disease in which only the skin is affected, and can often pass without treatment.</description>

      <description>How is the effectiveness of vaccines measured during clinical trials? Scientists cannot simply vaccinate children, infect them, and then see how many of them become ill. As such, the effectiveness of vaccines is measured by the number of antibodies that the immune system produces in response to vaccination. In the case of whooping cough (as is the case for other vaccines), we see that the opposite is true: the more antibodies the immune system produces, the higher the probability of contracting the disease.</description>

      <description>Another component of the pertussis acellular vaccine is pertactin. Pertactin is a protein normally located in the membrane of the pertussis bacterium. In countries where the acellular vaccine is used, the bacterial responsible for whooping cough are generally the pertussis without pertactin. Here are the studies of this phenomenon in Finland, United States, Japan and Australia, where strains without pertactin almost completely replaced strains with pertactin in just four years.</description>

      <description>The acellular vaccine, of course, is much less dangerous than the whole-cell vaccine, but, nevertheless, according to VAERS, 1,077 people have died after being administered this vaccine in the USA since 2002. Moreover, 1,009 became invalid, 8,700 were hospitalized, but less than 200 people died from whooping cough itself (note: of these individuals some had been vaccinated). In other words, the risk of dying from vaccination is at least five times higher than the risk of dying from whooping cough.</description>

      <description>In 1936, articles on the effectiveness of vitamin C against pertussis began to appear in the medical literature. The first study was by Otani in Japan, who administered the vitamin intravenously. Later, in 1937, an independent study by Omerod [1], [2] used the oral vitamin C to treat pertussis in Canada. Furthermore, in 1938, vitamin C was successfully used in a study by Vermillion to help cure pertussis in only a few days.</description>

      <description>The most frequent argument for the effectiveness of the pertussis vaccine is that when pertussis vaccination began in the 1950s, about 1,000 people were dying from pertussis per year, and now this number is much lower. However, if you look in more detail at the figures behind whooping cough-related mortality then it becomes clear that the vaccine has nothing to do with the reduction at all, since more than 90% of the decline in mortality occurred before vaccination began, and even before antibiotics were used.</description>

      <description>Films and Lectures:
DPT Vaccine Roulette A 1982 film about the DTP vaccine was shown on NBC. The main point of this film was to explain that the US switched to the acellular vaccine, and that the legislation related to vaccination was completely changed. It&#39;s impossible to imagine that this is shown on TV.

      <description>This is one of the most important studies because not only was it conducted by the FDA, but it also directly compares vaccinated subjects with unvaccinated ones, albeit baboons. The baboons were divided into four groups: the first group received three doses of a whole-cell vaccine, the second group received three doses of an acellular vaccine, the third group was not vaccinated, and the fourth group consisted of baboons that were not vaccinated but had previously been infected by pertussis.</description>

      <description>The authors performed a genetic analysis of pertussis bacterial strains in the Netherlands and concluded that the bacterium had mutated and adapted according to the vaccine. The predominate strains became those with different, mutated forms of pertactin and pertussis toxin. These strains did not exist before vaccination against pertussis began. The same trend was also observed in Finland, the USA and Italy.</description>

      <description>A systematic review of the effect of antibiotics on whooping cough conducted by Cochrane found that while antibiotics kill pertussis and reduce the probability that a person transmits the disease, they do not affect the actual course of the disease.
The use of antibiotics to help prevent infants from contracting pertussis is ineffective. Research has demonstrated that the use of antibiotics among children only leads to a longer illness.</description>

      <description>In the last 20 years, the incidence of whooping cough in many countries has increased significantly. Three hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon: 1) a weakening protective immunity from vaccination, 2) evolution of pertussis, and/or 3) low vaccination coverage. More recent studies have also suggested a fourth possible explanation: the asymptomatic infection of vaccinated individuals.
The authors of this study analysed the incidence of whooping cough in the US and the UK, conducted a genetic analysis of the bacterial strains, and concluded that the asymptomatic infection of vaccinated individuals is the most logical explanation.</description>

      <description>Accordingly, a new, more virulent strain of pertussis appeared among vaccinated individuals, a strain that did not exist before vaccination began. This strain, unfortunately, leads to more hospitalizations and deaths than the original strain.</description>

      <description>In an analysis of 11,000 children who received a whole-cell vaccine in Canada, those who received the first dose of the vaccine two months later than usual developed asthma far less often (2-fold lower chance). Furthermore, those who received all three doses of the vaccine later in childhood had a 2.5-fold lower risk of developing asthma.
This phenomenon is due to the fact that the immune reaction shifts towards Th2. The exact cause of asthma is not yet known, but according to one of the prevailing theories, asthma is caused by increased hygiene.</description>

      <description>This study is a meta-analysis comparing the efficacy between three and five doses of DTaP. The authors concluded that five doses of the vaccine are not more effective than three doses and that the vaccine is valid for only three years (this means that after three years, 50% of vaccinated children are no longer immune). After vaccination, the risk of contracting pertussis increases by 33% each year. In fact, three years is a long time considering an initial effectiveness of 85% was assumed.</description>

      <description>In vaccinated with whole-cell vaccine, the risk of allergy was 76% higher. In those who took antibiotics in the first two years of life, the risk of allergy was 2 times higher.
Taking one course of antibiotics increased the risk of developing an allergy by 85%, two courses of antibiotics increased the risk 3-fold, and three courses of antibiotics increased the risk 8-fold.
Those who had measles and had not received the vaccine, had a 45% lower risk of developing an allergy (note: in this case there was no statistical significance).</description>

      <description>An article by a British doctor states that, according to his long-term experience, whooping cough hasn&#39;t disappeared. In fact, after vaccination was implemented, whooping cough only disappeared from official records because doctors stopped diagnosing it.
This article reports that even though vaccination coverage against pertussis in England fell from 78% to 49% between the 1960s and the 1970s, whooping cough-related mortality during this same period decreased 3-fold.</description>

      <description>While the number of cases of whooping cough among unvaccinated individuals has increased, the number of cases among vaccinated individuals has increased even more. Most cases of whooping cough happen among vaccinated.
Also, according to data from the CDC, most patients with pertussis-induced whooping cough have been vaccinated.</description>

      <description>This is an epidemiological study in Spain analysing 421 cases of Pertussis, mostly in children under the age of one year. The vast majority of infected individuals (90%) had actually been fully vaccinated. The carriers were mostly fully vaccinated children aged 5-9 years. Only 8% of the 421 cases were hospitalized, and not one died. The authors conclude that despite a high level of vaccination in Spain, whooping cough is totally uncontrollable.</description>

      <description>While there are hundreds of case reports for different vaccines, we have not yet cited any until now. This case occurred in the year 2000, when a whole-cell (i.e., more effective) vaccine was administered to a 2-month-old child in Israel. Despite the entire family (mother, aunt and three brothers - 2, 5 and 11 years old) being fully vaccinated, the child died of whooping cough at an age of 4 months.</description>

      <description>A long but informative article on the history of the pertussis vaccine. If you still believe that the main goal of pharmaceutical companies is to create effective and safe drugs, this article might make you see things differently; we highly recommend reading it!
 The pertussis toxin is added to the whole-cell vaccine. This toxin increases the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, rendering this barrier more penetrable to other toxins and viruses.</description>

      <description>Let&#39;s now return to whooping cough.
 While the acellular pertussis vaccine shifts the immune response towards humoral immunity (Th2), the whole-cell vaccine is more associated with cellular immunity (Th1; the whole-cell vaccine also shifts the immune response towards Th2, but to a lesser extent). Even though the acellular vaccine contains far fewer antigens than the whole-cell vaccine, it contributes to the production of a greater amount of antibodies. Thus, the greater the number of doses of the acellular vaccine, the shorter the immunity from these vaccinations lasts.</description>

      <description>In Britain, pertussis vaccine coverage fell after the year 1975. Pertussis-related hospitalization declined between 1970-1983, and no cases of pertussis-induced encephalopathy, brain damage, lung damage, or death were reported between 1975-1982. There was no evidence of herd immunity, sufficient to protect babies.
The author of this study concludes that the risks related to pertussis vaccination are higher than the risks of whooping cough itself for people living in affluent areas of Britain.</description>

      <description>After 1978, it was discovered that 84% of pertussis patients had been vaccinated with three doses of the vaccine. Consequently, in 1979 Sweden stopped administering the vaccination. Only in 1996, when the acellular vaccine appeared, was vaccination reinstated.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, B. parapertussis (para-whooping cough) can occupy the place of the ordinary pertussis bacterium. Vaccination does not protect against B. parapertussis and, in fact, it is already responsible for 16% of all cases of the disease.
According to another study, parapertussis is actually responsible for 36% of whooping cough cases. In this study, while 62% of individuals with whooping cough had been vaccinated, 81% of those with para-whooping cough had been vaccinated.</description>
