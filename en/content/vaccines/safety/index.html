<p>We have already seen that safety of vaccines is tested without a real placebo, but only in the comparison to other vaccine, or in comparison with some other toxic compound. But this is not all. There are a few more problems with testing vaccines’ safety.</p>

 <a class="editLink" href="/scibook/en/content/vaccines/safety/001/">#</a>
    </section>
  </li>


  
   

  <li>
    <section class="article">
      
<p>First of all, nearly all of trials are done exclusively on healthy children, which does not stop manufacturers, FDA and CDC to recommend the vaccine to not so healthy children, premature babies, and not only children, and also children of a younger age.</p>

 <a class="editLink" href="/scibook/en/content/vaccines/safety/002/">#</a>
    </section>
  </li>


  
   

  <li>
    <section class="article">
      
<p>Secondly, nearly all clinical trials of safety are looking only for the short-term effects. Usually, they last from several days to several weeks. There are rarely trials that last several months. All of the side effects which happen after this period a-priory can not be related to the inoculation.</p>

  </li>


  
   

  <li>
    <section class="article">
      
<p>Thirdly, even if there are serious adverse effects occurring during the trial, scientists can decide that those adverse effects, or even death, are not related to the inoculation and can cross them out without taking into account.</p>

  <li>
    <section class="article">
      
<p>Fourthly, research is usually done on relatively small groups of children. For example, Hepatitis B vaccine <a href="https://www.fda.gov/downloads/biologicsbloodvaccines/vaccines/approvedproducts/ucm110114.pdf" target="_blank">was tested</a> on 147 newborns. Usually, vaccines are tested on children from third world countries, which halves the costs for clinical trials. Often, children and parents in the third world countries <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2893485/Children-guinea-pigs-anti-cervical-cancer-drug.html" target="_blank">do not know</a> that they are receiving an experimental vaccine. <a href="http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/88922/gsk-lab-fined-$1m-over-tests-that-killed-14-babies" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7BxnC6EUuo" target="_blank">[2]</a></p>

<p>Here is an <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00662870" target="_blank">example</a> of clinical trials of Daptacel vaccine. To take part in the trial a child should be absolutely healthy, born after the 37th week, not sensitive to any of the vaccine components, without developmental delays, the family should not have a history of immune diseases, and so on. More or less the same requirements are stated for all other vaccine trials. That is, in comparison to medicines, which are usually tested on ill patients and are then given to ill patient, vaccines are tested exclusively on healthy children and are then given to both, healthy and not so healthy children, and even very sick children.</p>

<p>This is an article that reports the results of the aforementioned study:<br />
Safety was tested for 30 and 60 days after each dose.<br />
In 5.2% children from the test group and also in 5.2% from the control group (which received 3 different inoculations) serious adverse effects were noticed. Scientists decided that these adverse effects were not related to the inoculation. Authors did not report what adverse effects there were and why they were excluded.</p>

<p>This is, more or less, how majority of safety trials look. They are rarely last longer than few days or weeks. Most of the time they have serious adverse events occurring in absolutely healthy children during this short period of time, and they are rarely happen to be related to vaccination. They are not related because in the control group, which receives a different vaccine or the same vaccines without an antigen, same events are registered. In these short clinical trials it is impossible to find autoimmune, oncological or neurological diseases, as well as many other diseases, which are not rare results of vaccination (it will be proven later), but that are not possible to be diagnosed earlier than few months or few years after vaccination.<br />
Moreover, vaccine inserts always state that there no trials of carcinogenicity of the medicine, mutagenecity and its possible effect on reproductive system were conducted.</p>

<p>By the way, in order for a child to be able to participate in clinical trials, he needs to be fully vaccinated with other vaccines. This is done in order to weed out very sensitive children, which have a tendency to become autistic, disabled or generally unhealthy after vaccination.</p>
