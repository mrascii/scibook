<p>My wife also thought vaccines were safe and effective. They were taught this. I asked her how many hours during the whole period of her training she had, had been devoted to vaccinations. It turned out that only a few hours. Of these, for two hours they taught about the vaccination schedule, and for another two hours there was a lecture on &ldquo;how to respond to anti-vaccination arguments.&rdquo; By the way, after this lecture, almost all the students said that the lecturer&rsquo;s arguments did not convince them, and that the arguments of the anti-vaccinations were more convincing. They, of course, did not think that the anti-vaccine handlers were somehow right. They decided that the lecturer simply did not prepare well for this lecture.</p>

<p>Most people believe that a doctor can treat as he sees fit. Far from it. If, for example, a doctor read several scientific articles and came to the conclusion that it is better to treat a certain disease in some other way, he has no right to do so. The doctor must follow the permitted treatment protocols, otherwise he will lose his license. If the doctor advises the patient about any unapproved medicine, for example, to treat whooping cough with vitamin C, and not with an antibiotic, and something happens to the patient, the doctor will go to court. If the doctor prescribes antibiotics (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15674946" target="_blank">not particularly effective</a> in whooping cough), and something happens the patient, the doctor will not bear any responsibility. What is the point of the doctor advising the patient something that is not approved by the protocol?<br />
Similarly, the doctor, by and large, does not have the right to advise the patient not to get vaccinated. He may very quickly lose his license (especially in the USA), and even if he does not lose it, his career will not go far.<br />
Nevertheless, there are many doctors openly opposing vaccinations. Of course, these are always doctors with their own private practice.</p>

<p>If you ask my wife, as a doctor, if she advises you to be vaccinated, and she does not trust you, she will answer that she does advise it. Vaccinations, she recites, is the greatest gift of medicine to humanity, they saved millions of lives.<br />
If you ask her if she is vaccinating her child and she trusts you completely, she will explain that she will scratch out the eyes of someone who will approach the child with the vaccine, and will advise you to do the same.<br />
Therefore, it is important to ask the right question. More importantly, the doctor to whom you ask the question must fully trust you, and must not think you could complain about him, or publish his advice.<br />
Of course, most doctors are likely to vaccinate their children. But only because they are taught almost nothing about vaccines. Therefore, it is also important to ask the doctor how many scientific articles about the safety and efficacy of vaccines he has read. Ask him to also give you a chance to read at least one study proving the safety of the vaccine he is about to inject.</p>

<p>Yet many doctors take risks, and do not advise their patients to get vaccinated. Here are a few studies:</p>

A third of the doctors did not vaccinate their children against hepatitis B and hemophilic bacilli. Only 12% were vaccinated against the flu, and only 3% were vaccinated against chickenpox. 34% of pediatricians did not vaccinate their children according to the vaccination schedule.<br />
The survey involved only InfoVac subscribers, that is, doctors who are actively interested in vaccinations. From which it follows that the actual number of doctors who do not vaccinate their children is probably much more. (Switzerland)</p>

  <span class="font-italic">2012, Baron-Epel, Vaccine</span>
</h6>

<p>After Israeli nurses were asked to vaccinate against whooping cough at 3 months, only 2% (two percent) deigned to do so. And we are talking about nurses working in mother and child centers (tipat halav), that is, those whose main role is to vaccinate children.<br />
Most nurses do not trust health authorities, and desperately resist compulsory vaccinations.<br />
They believe that parents should have the choice to vaccinate a child or not, and they demand the same respect for their rights.<br />
Nurses share work and personal life. The fact that their work is to inculcate children is one thing. And whether they are vaccinated themselves or not, it is their own business, and they do not consider it necessary to inform parents of their opinion about vaccinations, or whether they themselves are vaccinated.<br />
The authors of the study concluded that the nurses who do the vaccinations are, in fact, anti-vaccinations. (Israel)</p>

<p>This is probably the most important study of all presented here. In almost all other studies, data was collected from surveys of doctors. Doctors perfectly understand that they should not negatively react about vaccinations, therefore it is logical to assume that the real number of doctors who do not vaccinate their children is much higher. The data in this study is real, they are not based on surveys. 98% of nurses whose main role is to vaccinate children refuse to be vaccinated themselves!<br />
Israeli doctors, however, also <a href="https://www.vesty.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5028846,00.html" target="_blank">refuse</a> to be vaccinated against the flu.</p>

<p>Swiss nurses are skeptical of infectious diseases and the vaccine against influenza.<br />
Outbreaks of diseases are always less dangerous than announced by public health authorities and the media, reducing public confidence in the reliability of expert sources of information. Conflict of interest between public organizations and private corporations also reduces public confidence.</p>
