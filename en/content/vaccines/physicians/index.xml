      <description>Argument: &amp;ldquo;If there were any problems with vaccinations, if they were unsafe or ineffective, doctors would know about it, but at present there is almost complete medical consensus - vaccinations are safe and effective. After all, doctors, for their long years of training, probably learned more about vaccinations than you read about them on the Internet&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>My wife also thought vaccines were safe and effective. They were taught this. I asked her how many hours during the whole period of her training she had, had been devoted to vaccinations. It turned out that only a few hours. Of these, for two hours they taught about the vaccination schedule, and for another two hours there was a lecture on &amp;ldquo;how to respond to anti-vaccination arguments.&amp;rdquo; By the way, after this lecture, almost all the students said that the lecturer&amp;rsquo;s arguments did not convince them, and that the arguments of the anti-vaccinations were more convincing.</description>

      <description>But maybe in other universities everything is different? That&amp;rsquo;s how much they teach about vaccinations in the most prestigious American universities. Of the 6,700 pages that a medical college student must learn, only 4 pages are devoted to vaccinations.</description>

      <description>Doctors have a financial interest in vaccinations. The more vaccines they sell, the higher their bonus..
The insurance company Blue Cross Blue Shield, for example, pays doctors $ 400 for each fully vaccinated child. But only if the percentage of vaccinated in practice is above 63%. This is the main reason pediatricians in the United States refuse to treat unvaccinated children.</description>

      <description>Argument: &amp;ldquo;But I talked with several doctors, and they all say that vaccinations are safe. Moreover, doctors would not have vaccinated their children if they considered vaccinations unsafe &amp;ldquo;.</description>

      <description>Most people believe that a doctor can treat as he sees fit. Far from it. If, for example, a doctor read several scientific articles and came to the conclusion that it is better to treat a certain disease in some other way, he has no right to do so. The doctor must follow the permitted treatment protocols, otherwise he will lose his license. If the doctor advises the patient about any unapproved medicine, for example, to treat whooping cough with vitamin C, and not with an antibiotic, and something happens to the patient, the doctor will go to court.</description>

      <description>If you ask my wife, as a doctor, if she advises you to be vaccinated, and she does not trust you, she will answer that she does advise it. Vaccinations, she recites, is the greatest gift of medicine to humanity, they saved millions of lives.
If you ask her if she is vaccinating her child and she trusts you completely, she will explain that she will scratch out the eyes of someone who will approach the child with the vaccine, and will advise you to do the same.</description>

      <description>Swiss nurses are skeptical of infectious diseases and the vaccine against influenza.
Outbreaks of diseases are always less dangerous than announced by public health authorities and the media, reducing public confidence in the reliability of expert sources of information. Conflict of interest between public organizations and private corporations also reduces public confidence.</description>

      <description>After Israeli nurses were asked to vaccinate against whooping cough at 3 months, only 2% (two percent) deigned to do so. And we are talking about nurses working in mother and child centers (tipat halav), that is, those whose main role is to vaccinate children.
Most nurses do not trust health authorities, and desperately resist compulsory vaccinations.
They believe that parents should have the choice to vaccinate a child or not, and they demand the same respect for their rights.</description>
