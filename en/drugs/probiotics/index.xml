      <description>Probiotics may help in the treatment of cervical dysplasia.
Vitamins C, A, E, vitamin D, group B vitamins, green tea extract, turmeric and healthy vaginal flora significantly reduce the risk of dysplasia.
That is, if you do not smoke, do not take oral contraceptives, eat well, do not destroy vaginal microflora with douching chemicals, get pap-smears once in a while, then the risk of cervical cancer, which is already very low, is reduced to almost zero without any vaccinations.</description>
