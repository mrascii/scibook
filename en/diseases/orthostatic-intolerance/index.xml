      <description>Orthostatic intolerance is a decrease in pressure upon rising from a sitting or lying position. The authors analyzed the symptoms of 35 girls who came to them. All of them had orthostatic intolerance start, on average, 9 days after the vaccination, but they were diagnosed two years later, on average. Most of them also had severe headaches, nausea, cognitive disorders, rapid heartbeat, weakness, tremor, sleeping problems, rash, neuropathic pain, etc. Five girls could not get about without a wheelchair.</description>
