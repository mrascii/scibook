      <description>Even though this article is mainly about the role of aluminum in the Alzheimer’s disease, it also lists the currently known mechanisms of aluminum’s influence on biological processes.
Despite the fact that aluminum is one of the most common metals on Earth, in nature it is found only in the compounds with silicon and oxygen. Men only learned how to produce pure aluminum and create aluminum salts in the late nineteenth century.</description>

      <description> The closer the arteries are to the brain, the higher is the concentration of aluminum in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.
Patients with familial form of Alzheimer’s have been found to have incredibly high levels of aluminum in their brains.
