      <description>Aluminum in antiperspirants blocks the sweat glands preventing them from releasing sweat, which is what makes them so effective. The cause of 90% of breast cancer is environmental, not genetic. In 1926 only 31% of cancer tumors were located in upper outer part of the breast. In 1994 the numbers increased to 61%. This proportion is growing linearly each year. Genomic instability in outer part of the breast is constantly increasing.</description>
