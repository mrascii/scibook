 The cause of 90% of breast cancer is environmental, not genetic.
 In 1926 only 31% of cancer tumors were located in upper outer part of the breast. In 1994 the numbers increased to 61%. This proportion is growing linearly each year.
 Genomic instability in outer part of the breast is constantly increasing.</description>
