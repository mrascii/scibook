In 1936, articles on the effectiveness of vitamin C against pertussis began to appear in the medical literature. The first study was by [Otani](https://www.seanet.com/~alexs/ascorbate/193x/otani-t-klin_wchnschr-1936-v15-n51-p1884-eng.htm) in Japan, who administered the vitamin intravenously. Later, in 1937, an independent study by Omerod [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1562195/), [[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC536087/) used the oral vitamin C to treat pertussis in Canada. Furthermore, in 1938, vitamin C was successfully used in a study by [Vermillion](https://www.seanet.com/~alexs/ascorbate/193x/vermillion-el-etal-kansas_city_med_j-1938-v39-n11-p469.htm) to help cure pertussis in only a few days. It has also been reported that young infants who are breastfed are practically freed of pertussis because of the high vitamin C level in their motherÂ´s milk.
In 1938, a controlled trial [found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2210412/) that vitamin C is not more effective than a control substance. However, cod liver oil, belladonna and bromide were used as control substances despite the fact that in an [article](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(02)78664-9/fulltext) published in Lancet in 1871 it was shown that whooping cough could be successfully treated using cod liver oil. Even then, scientists have known a lot about choosing a placebo. In the 1950s, several more articles were published on the treatment of pertussis with vitamin C. At that point, however, a vaccine appeared and vitamin C was completely forgotten. As a result, during the past 70 years no one has made further investigations into the benefits of vitamin C against pertussis. Nonetheless, some doctors and parents still successfully [use](http://drsuzanne.net/2015/04/the-vitamin-c-treatment-of-whooping-cough-suzanne -humphries-md/) it to treat and prevent whooping cough.
