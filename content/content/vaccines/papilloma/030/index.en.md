Healthy mice, whose diet was supplemented with a low concentration of Polysorbate 80, [developed](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v519/n7541/full/nature14232.html]) an intestinal inflammation. They had obesity, metabolic syndrome and colitis. Polysorbate 80 also changed intestinal microflora and increased the inflammatory potential. The authors conclude that using Polysorbate 80 and similar emulsifiers contributed to the increase in the number of cases of obesity, metabolic syndrome and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
Polysorbate 80 also [plays a role](http://gut.bmj.com/content/59/10/1331.full) in the development of the Crohn’s disease.
Polysorbate 80 is usually added to ice cream, gum, gelatin, mayonnaise, various sauces, etc.
