After the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published a report stating that the HPV vaccine is completely safe, the Scandinavian division of Cochrane filed a [complaint](http://nordic.cochrane.org/sites/nordic.cochrane.org/files/uploads/ResearchHighlights/Complaint-to-EMA-over-EMA.pdf) with the EMA. In the 19-page letter Cochrane provides evidence of the report having been written by people with conflict of interest, which they forgot to mention. The letter also says that they completely ignored testimonies, expert opinions and evidence of this vaccine being unsafe.
