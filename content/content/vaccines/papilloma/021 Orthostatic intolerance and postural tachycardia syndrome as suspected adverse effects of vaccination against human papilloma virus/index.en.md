Orthostatic intolerance is a decrease in pressure upon rising from a sitting or lying position. The authors analyzed the symptoms of 35 girls who came to them. All of them had orthostatic intolerance start, on average, 9 days after the vaccination, but they were diagnosed two years later, on average. Most of them also had severe headaches, nausea, cognitive disorders, rapid heartbeat, weakness, tremor, sleeping problems, rash, neuropathic pain, etc. Five girls could not get about without a wheelchair. Anyone who did not take birth control pill had irregular menstrual cycle. All but one could not function normally and 21 of them were forced to quit their studies or job.
**Before vaccination all girls were professionally involved in sports, half of them on a national or international level.**
The fact that doing sports leads to intensified response to the vaccine was established in other studies as well.
Another similar [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/pubmed/24102827) of 6 girls.
