Despite the manufacturer’s claims that the vaccine is purified and does not contain papillomavirus DNA, all 16 of the tested doses, collected from around the world, had fragments of the virus’s DNA.
Since these fragments are bonded with aluminum, (which is devoured and spread throughout the body through the lymphatic system by macrophages), these virus DNA fragments enter all organs, and further enhance the autoimmune response. However, there could easily be a whole live virus, not just the fragments, which will infect the whole body, instead of the usual way of infecting only the cells of the skin, vagina or throat. Moreover, because the virus is bonded with aluminum, and macrophages do not know what do to with this aluminum, DNA fragments become protected by the aluminum and are not disposed of.
Gardasil’s papillomavirus DNA was also found in the blood and spleen of the 16-year-old girl that died six months after being vaccinated.
In this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7hjwXODy_8) the author of the article explains in more detail what the papillomavirus DNA in a vaccine can lead to.
FDA quickly [declared](https://www.fda.gov/biologic sbloodvaccines/vaccines/approvedproducts/ucm276859.htm)] that the presence of DNA fragments is not at all dangerous and was even expected. Although [according to](https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/briefing/2006-4222B1.pdf) the documents submitted to FDA by Merck, there are no fragments there.
