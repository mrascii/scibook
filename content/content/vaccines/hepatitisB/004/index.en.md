Why vaccinate a newborn baby against an STD, which they virtually have no chance of contracting? Well, simply [because==http://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/01/us/us-panel-urges-that -all-children-be-vaccinated-for-hepatitis-b.html] the adult drug addicts and gay people refused to get vaccinated. Therefore, it was decided to vaccinate children immediately after birth, while they are not yet able to refuse. Most family doctors and pediatricians did not support this venture.
